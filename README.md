The first on-chain slot experience built for the pump.fun community. Hold the token, register your wallet, and spin to climb the leaderboard. Payouts are transparent, automatic, and based on the jackpot that grows with volume.

## How it works
- **Holders-only access:** You must hold the token to play (checked on-chain).
- **Leaderboard:** Every spin can earn points. Top 10 places share the prize each round.
- **Jackpot funding:** 40% of creator fees feed the jackpot; 60% stays with the creator treasury.
- **Round payouts:** Every round (default 10 minutes), the pot pays out:
  - 1st 30% · 2nd 20% · 3rd 15% · 4th 10%  
  - 5th–10th split the remaining 25%  
  *(Minimum payout 0.01 SOL; if shares fall below min, the jackpot rolls over.)*

## Get started
1. Buy the token on pump.fun.
2. Open the site, connect & **register** your holder wallet.
3. Hit **Play** and rack up points before the timer ends.

## Fair play & transparency
